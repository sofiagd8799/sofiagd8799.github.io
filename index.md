## About

![Sofía García Durrer](/foto_rf.jpeg){: .align-left .profile-float width="400"}

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Research Training Group
[The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy (DYNAMICS)](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics),
coordinated by the Department of Social Sciences at
[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the
[Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/), and funded by the
[German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en).

I am Colombian–Swiss and based in Germany. Currently living in Berlin, I focus my research on Europe and Latin America.
I am particularly interested in projects at the intersection of academic research and policy implementation or evaluation,
and I would be glad to contribute or share insights from my (upcoming) research on initiatives with a strong practical application.
Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:s.garcia-durrer@phd.hertie-school.org) if you’d like to connect or explore potential collaborations.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about photography: portraits, street life, and landscapes are my main focus. I often combine photography with hiking, chasing the kinds of views that make the effort worthwhile. I also love reading, and I share reflections on both photography and books [here](/hobbies/).

## My research interests

My research sits at the intersection of international development, gender and (micro-)economics, social and family policy, and computational social science. I focus on the care economy and the ways in which public policies shape family dynamics and the division of labor within households. In particular, I apply a wide range of quantitative methods to examine how the division of labor between partners shapes relationship outcomes and how policies can mitigate or exacerbate these dynamics by influencing couples’ decisions about care, employment, and family life.

My main PhD supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Michaela Kreyenfeld](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/kreyenfeld) (Hertie School, Berlin).

**Keywords:** care economy · division of labor · family dynamics · policy evaluation · causal inference · computational social science
