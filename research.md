#### I have been a co-author of two research notes published on the website of the [Fundación Interra](https://fundacioninterra.org/) in Colombia: 

+ [NT 6:La descentralización en Colombia: una mirada desde las diferencias regionales y las capacidades institucionales/ Decentralization in Colombia: a view from regional differences and institutional capacities with Celina Gaitán](https://publicaciones.fundacioninterra.org/documentos_interra/nt-6-la-descentralizacion-en-colombia-una-mirada-desde-las-diferencias-regionales-y-las-capacidades-institucionales/))

+ [NT 7: Índice de Inclusión Laboral Poblacional-INLAP/ Labor Inclusion Index with Paola VAnegas, Camila Espinosa and Eduard Arias](https://publicaciones.fundacioninterra.org/documentos_interra/nt-7-indice-de-inclusion-laboral-poblacional-inlap-2/): The Interra Foundation developed the Labor Inclusion Index for the Colombian Population (INLAP) as the first comprehensive tool to diagnose and measure labor inclusion in Colombia. It addresses structural barriers that prevent vulnerable groups from accessing quality education, job intermediation, and formal employment opportunities.

    + The Index had three main pillars: 

         + Enabling Conditions of the Territory - Infrastructure: education, training, labor intermediation, business ecosystem, connectivity, and care services.
         + Employment Pathways - Secondary/post-secondary education enrollment & completion, vocational training, transition programs, and labor intermediation effectiveness.
         + Inclusive Employment - Indicators of unemployment, participation, informality, income, and youth NEET rates for the nine vulnerable groups.

    +  Policy Recommendations:
          + Education: Strengthen secondary-to-postsecondary transition, technical/professional training, retention strategies.
          + Labor intermediation: Improve public employment services, expand coverage, and promote efficient matching.
          + Infrastructure: Expand digital connectivity, care services, and business ecosystems.
          + Inclusive employment: Programs for income generation, enterprise creation, formalization, and support for vulnerable populations.
          + Monitoring: Continuous evaluation of labor outcomes with a population-based approach.
