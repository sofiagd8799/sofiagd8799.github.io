## Selected Student Feedback

> “The TA is extremely helpful in class and won't leave you behind in a lesson if you aren't understanding something, as well as if you're having trouble with R. She's very understanding and willing to help you outside of class, as well as after class ends. The review of the lecture at the beginning of every lab is helpful too.”
